# extraLongFactorials
Calculate and print the factorial of a given integer.
The code defines two classes: Result and Solution. The Result class contains the extraLongFactorials() method that takes an integer n as a parameter and calculates the factorial of n using the BigInteger data type and the multiply() method. The Solution class contains the main() method that reads the input value of n from the user, and calls the extraLongFactorials() method from the Result class.
The code imports the java.io.* and java.math.* libraries, which are used to handle input and output operations, and perform mathematical operations using the BigInteger class, respectively.
